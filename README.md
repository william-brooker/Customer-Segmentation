# Customer-Segmentation
I conducted a customer segmentation analysis for a company akin to Booking.com ahead of the launch of their new rewards scheme.

TravelTide maintains a intense focus on cultivating an advantage within a limited set of dimensions, particularly by constructing the most extensive travel inventory and ensuring its easy accessibility.

Due to this targeted approach, certain facets of the TravelTide customer experience remain underdeveloped, leading to suboptimal customer retention. CEO Kevin Talanick is highly motivated to enhance customer retention and add value to existing customers through a marketing strategy founded on a thorough understanding of customer behavior.

Note: This is a fictitious company with fictitious data provided by a bootcamp.

My Mission

My mission is to leverage SQL and Python to derive concrete insights into customer segmentation using the K-MEANS clustering algorithm based on the perks outlined by the Head of Marketing, Elena.

REQUIREMENTS

Audience

This project is internal for a the marketing team with a non techincal audience which I have adpted the report to reflect, yet it maintains a meticulously commented and well-structured approach in the code for a technical audience.

Key Considerations

Here are some questions to ponder as we delve into the business problem and explore the TravelTide database:

1.What travel behaviors indicate an affinity to each perk? For instance, what type of customer might be particularly interested in a free checked bag?

2.Which fields in the database contain information about these behaviors?

3.How should the data be configured (e.g., filtered, aggregated) to prevent a logically flawed segmentation analysis?
